what type of solver is the kul's one?
	can already existing fuzzers do the trick?
	(lexical) AFLplusplus, python-afl (guided fuzzer), libFuzzer, honggfuzz, ClusterFuzz
	(constraint based) KLEE
	can Z3 (or others) be used as an oracle? is already build in via the 3 possible solvers

Fuzzing
	parser
		can we use the parser of CPMpy? no since we want to find bugs in there
	write own needs to be limited in scope

create fuzzer (random, by parser, by stoch knowledge) pref sat by construction to find crit bugs
test solver, compare with oracle or sat by construction, 
categorize faults, 
simplify faults by delta-debugging or own try and error


CPMpy
	model -= constraint werkt niet, model.constraints=model.constraints[selectie]
