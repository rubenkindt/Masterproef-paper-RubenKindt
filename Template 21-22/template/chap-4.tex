\begin{quote}
	"Constraint programming represents one of the closest approaches computer science has yet made to the Holy Grail of programming: the user states the problem, the computer solves it." \cite{11freuder1997pursuitHolyGrail} quote by Eugene C. Freuder
\end{quote}
As the quote and paper Eugene C. Freuder asserts, he believes that the

%\cite{56bardin2019bringing} gives nice overview of constraint solving in general


\section{CP}
%\cite{53marriott1998programming}
% compaierde to traditional programming 1 relations expresseeed isnstead of 1 relation needing to be expreassed from all possible viewspoints (SEND + MORE = MONEY as example)

%constraint satisfaction and constraint solving 
%Generate and Test is bad papaer 52
% CP is good at scheduling problems paper 52
%Limitations NP-hard and efficiency

%CVC4 CVC5  \footnote{\url{https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5}} the fifth in line of the build Cooperating Validity Checkers (CVC), the previous where (CVC, CVC Lite, CVC3 end CVC4) \cite{62barrettcvc5} \cite{63barbosa2022cvc5}
%mention techniques branching, unit propagation, backtracking, DPLL, CDCL, 2 watched literals, heuristics: detpth, breadth first, Variable state independent decaying sum/VSIDS, dynamic largest individual sum (DLIS), clause deletion, random restarts \cite{60katebi2011empirical} \cite{61MCSMarcDenecker}
% CVC5 has API's for C++, Python and Java


\section{Conclusion}
\todo{Conclusion}
The final section of the chapter gives an overview of the important results
of this chapter. This implies that the introductory chapter and the
concluding chapter don't need a conclusion.
