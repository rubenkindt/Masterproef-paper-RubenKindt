\label{cha:1}
A chapter is a logical unit. It normally starts with an introduction, which
you are reading now. The last topic of the chapter holds the conclusion.

\section{History}
The big start of fuzzing came when Miller gave a classroom assignment \cite{FuzzingAssignment} in 1988 to his computer science students to test Unix utilities with randomly generated inputs with the goal to break the utilities. Two years later in December he wrote a paper \cite{originalFuzzingUnixUtils} about the remarkable results. That more than 24\% to 33\% of the programs crashed.

\section{Seed selection}
%Please don't abuse enumerations: short enumerations shouldn't use
%``\verb|itemize|'' or ``\texttt{enumerate}'' environments.
%So \emph{never write}: 
%\begin{quote}
%  The Eiffel tower has three floors:
 % \begin{itemize}
 % \item the first one;
 % \item the second one;
 % \item the third one.
  %\end{itemize}
%\end{quote}
%But write:
%\begin{quote}
%  The Eiffel tower has three floors: the first one, the second one, and the
%  third one.
%\end{quote}

\section{Conclusion}
The final section of the chapter gives an overview of the important results
of this chapter. This implies that the introductory chapter and the
concluding chapter don't need a conclusion.
