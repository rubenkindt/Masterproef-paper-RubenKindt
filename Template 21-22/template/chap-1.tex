%	binary search will not work all the time
%	quarters remove may work (if all parts fail go more granular, 1/9 or 1/16)
%		start with halfs then *2
%		always search further with same granularity but with removed part until all options with that granularity searched \ref{zeller2009programs} p111
%		this uses no knowledge from input structure and program structure \ref{zeller2009programs} p112
%	delta debugging
%		time spend searching vs simplified ratio is important as mentioned in \ref{mansur2020detecting}
%		and needs to preserve satisfiability as mentioned in \ref{mansur2020detecting}

%	or isolaytion \ref{zeller2009programs} p 285 
%		I think it may fail if multiple parts are relevant
%		I think it could detect for example the CPMpy import as a bug cause as the min diff that causes the bug

\chapter{The First Chapter}
\label{cha:1}
A chapter is a logical unit. It normally starts with an introduction, which
you are reading now. The last topic of the chapter holds the conclusion.

\section{The First Topic of the Chapter}
First comes the introduction to this topic.

\subsection{An item}
Please don't abuse enumerations: short enumerations shouldn't use
``\verb|itemize|'' or ``\texttt{enumerate}'' environments.
So \emph{never write}: 
\begin{quote}
  The Eiffel tower has three floors:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the first one;
  \item the second one;
  \item the third one.
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}
But write:
\begin{quote}
  The Eiffel tower has three floors: the first one, the second one, and the
  third one.
\end{quote}

\section{A Second Topic}
\lipsum[64]

\subsection{Another item}
\lipsum[56-57]

\section{Conclusion}
The final section of the chapter gives an overview of the important results
of this chapter. This implies that the introductory chapter and the
concluding chapter don't need a conclusion.
