A chapter is a logical unit. It normally starts with an introduction, which
you are reading now. The last topic of the chapter holds the conclusion.

\section{The First Topic of the Chapter}
First comes the introduction to this topic.

\subsection{An item}
Please don't abuse enumerations: short enumerations shouldn't use
``\verb|itemize|'' or ``\texttt{enumerate}'' environments.
So \emph{never write}: 
\begin{quote}
  The Eiffel tower has three floors:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the first one;
  \item the second one;
  \item the third one.
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}
But write:
\begin{quote}
  The Eiffel tower has three floors: the first one, the second one, and the
  third one.
\end{quote}

\section{A Second Topic}

\subsection{Another item}

\section{Conclusion}
The final section of the chapter gives an overview of the important results
of this chapter. This implies that the introductory chapter and the
concluding chapter don't need a conclusion.
