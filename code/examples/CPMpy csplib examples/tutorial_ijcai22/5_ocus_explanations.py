# Explaining Unsatisfiability

In the previous notebookm we have seen that when errors can occur during modeling of constrained problems one can debug these models by extracting the unsatisfiable constraints. 
In that case, a minimal subset of unsatisfiable constraints (MUS, a.k.a Minimal Unsatisfiable Subset) forms an explanation of unsatisfiability [1]. 

MUS extraction algorithms such as MUSX [2] from  doesn't guarantee optimality. It does not guarantee to find the smallest one (*subset minimality* of the MUS) and since it does not allow for sepcifying weigths, there is no guarantee cost-optimality.

A ___Smallest Minimal Unsatisfiable Subset (SMUS)___ [3] forms the ___simplest/easiest___ explanation of UNSAT when all cosntraints are considered equally important, i.e. ___unweighted___ constraints.

When weights are assigned to constraint, an ___Optimal Constrained Unsatisfiable Subset (OCUS)___ [4] of the constraints will be the ___simplest/easiest___ explanation of UNSAT.

In this notebook, we consider an algorithm for computing OCUSs to illustrate the effect of assumptions, incrementality and multiple-solvers.

__OCUS__ algorithm is based on the implicit hitting set duality between Minimum Unsatisfiable Subsets (MUS) and Minimum Correction Subsets (MCS) .

We apply the MUS-extraction technique on a toy an int-variable CP model.

# Optimal Unsatisfiable Subsets

OCUS, or Optimal Constrained Unsatisfiable SUbsets, is a cost-optimal unsatisfiable subset that allows for a structural constraint.
The OCUS algorithm takes advantage of the implicit hitting set duality between Minimum Correction Subsets and Minimum Unsatisfiable Subsets to efficiently compute an OCUS.
