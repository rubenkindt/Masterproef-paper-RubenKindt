\section{Achievements}
\label{con:Achievements}
found bugs, 
semi automatic more on that later in the next section 
found metamorphic testing yet to be a bit better compared to the others
found some smaller edge case bugs where CPMpy did not follow specific solvers specifications, for example the power bug of Gurobi \ref{res:bug:Power}


addition to other form of testing, 
voordelen automatisch testen: tijdswinst, safer program

\section{Limitations}
\label{con:Limitations}
frequently finding the same bug
add exception once a bug is found for that specific bug and rerunning again manual work
-> best use during development instead of when a release is wanted. 
Which may not be a bad way of working.

working with seeds did limit us
%problems limited by global fucntions of used seeds (somewhat fine),
diversity of the seed files  



STORM originated from as a SMT fuzzer, we changed it to be able to handle CP's 
but it still modified problem models like it was a SMT; With and's and not's

\subsection{CTORM}
Techniques are best applied during development, since Ctorm of to often detects the already found bugs
only 'and' and 'not' combinations Just like STORM



\subsection{Metamorphic testing}
bug wrong bound would have been found if we logged the crashes of the original file 

did not find ~(~()) simply because we didn't think to check it specifically, we did check ~=0
all checks ? + combo-able

meta testing requires extra manual work
manual written (= work, although not much work), own choice on how complex you make the relations(simple ones work too), still need the creativity, all relations seem to be "why would this crash this is pointless to write" but do crash sometimes

created cyclic expressions, a bug that was discovered by Jo DeVriendt in bug number \href{www.todo.be}{163}

\section{Future work}
\label{con:FutureWork}

new code = new bugs

adding knowledge of already found bugs while searching for the next bug


testing configuration space a swell \cite{42FalconFuzzingConfigurationSettingsAndNormal}
we only did configuration space of the solvers, it may be intresting to know how CP's including CPMpy react to changes or attributes that tell the solver to solve in a special way 
or solver interface functions 


%\todo{CPMpy is in Alpha}
